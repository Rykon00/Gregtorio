# Roadmap: GregTech: New Horizons progression

The goal is the GTNH progression (tier gating, key materials, the big multiblocks) on top of
the upstream Gregtorio drafts, adapted to Factorio: fewer steps where GT only adds tedium, same
order of tiers and the same key materials. One phase per pull request.

Every phase leaves the game playable: the tier's science pack is craftable, its techs are
researchable, every unlocked recipe can be made, and everything unfinished stays a hidden
draft (`FORK-DRAFT` in the log). Checked with `tools/devcheck` (see its README).

Science packs: LuV = space, ZPM = metallurgic, UV = agricultural, UHV = electromagnetic,
UEV = cryogenic, then promethium / UMV / UXV / max.

| Phase | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Finish LuV: naquadah ore line, bacterial vat, mutagen, crystal processors, circuit assembly line, fusion reactor MK1 and the first plasmas | **done** (`prototypes/125-fork-luv-endgame.lua`) |
| 2 | ZPM: ZPM science pack, ZPM components and machines (europium, naquadah alloy, osmiridium), ZPM energy hatch | open, next |
| 3 | UV: fusion reactor MK2 (and its plasmas), wetware processors, crystal processor mainframe (UV circuit), UV components | open |
| 4 | UHV: fusion reactor MK3, UHV components and circuits | open |
| 5 | UEV .. UXV and the endgame (stargate, victory) | open |
| side | Water purification line (grades 1-8; the draft in `21-luv-age-item.lua` is commented out) | open |
| side | AE2 autocrafting (patterns, molecular assembler on top of the ME network from `120-fork-ae2.lua`) | open |

## Phase 1: LuV (done)

Numbers: researchable technologies 238 -> 246 of 290 -> 298 (the 8 new ones), draft recipes
hidden by the draft guard 88 -> 65. Progression now stops at the ZPM science pack
(`metallurgic-science-pack` is researchable but the pack has no recipe yet).

New technologies (all LuV science):

| Technology | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `naquadah-processing` | naquadah from the end microminer, the GoodGenerator line (fluoroantimonic acid, emulsion, P-507, neutron activator), naquadah ingot and dust |
| `enriched-naquadah` | enriched naquadah, naquadria dust, trinium |
| `naquadah-alloy` | naquadah alloy (alloy blast smelter), osmiridium, their plates and dense plates |
| `bacterial-vat` | bacterial vat, growth medium, bacterial sludge, enriched sludge, mutagen |
| `circuit-assembly-line` | circuit assembly line (crystal processors, also every circuit assembler recipe up to LuV) |
| `crystal-processors` | emerald plates, raw/engraved crystal chips, crystal CPU, circuit wraps, crystal processor (IV), assembly (LuV), supercomputer (ZPM) |
| `fusion-reactor-mk1` | niobium-titanium foil, superconducting coil, fusion coil, fusion reactor MK1 |
| `fusion-plasmas-mk1` | tritium (from deuterium), helium-3 (from end stone), helium, boron, calcium and neon plasma, europium, duranium, sunnarium |

`metallurgic-science-pack` (the ZPM science tech) now requires `fusion-plasmas-mk1` and
`crystal-processors`.

### Open points from phase 1

- Still drafts, need later tiers: crystal processor mainframe (UV circuit, ITBTC/enderium
  superconductor wire), force plasma (arcanite), all MK2+ fusion recipes, lapotronic energy orb
  cluster (qubit processing unit, naquadah alloy foil), the naquadah fuel line
  (`acid-naquadah-emulsion`, naquadah fuels for the naquadah generator).
- Plasmas are only ingredients so far; there is no plasma generator (GT plasma turbine).
- Fusion in GT needs a start-up energy buffer per recipe; here it is a normal machine with a
  high power draw (40.96 MW).
- Balance: the assembly line now runs at IV speed (16) instead of 1, so assembly line recipes take
  GT time (a LuV motor took 8 minutes before); the circuit assembly line runs at 2x LuV speed.
- Graphics of the new multiblocks are generated placeholders from GT textures
  (`tools/gen_sprites.py`); they need a look in the real game.

Outside the phases: some vanilla technologies (armor equipment, inserter capacity bonus,
`bulk-inserter`, `explosives`, ...) are not researchable in `devcheck`; that was already the case
before phase 1 and has not been looked into yet.

### Suggested next step

Phase 2 (ZPM): ZPM science pack recipe (europium, naquadah alloy, ZPM circuit), ZPM components
from the drafts in `23-zpm-age-item.lua`, ZPM machines with `fork_make_tier_machine(base, "luv",
"zpm", ...)` and the ZPM energy hatch. The MK2 plasma drafts stay hidden until phase 3 (fusion MK2).
